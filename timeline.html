              <li>The most common college savings plan is a 529. There are a couple of 529 plans you can use to pay for college tuition and expenses. A 529 savings plan, for example, can provide tax advantages on investments. </li>
            </ul>

          <li><b>Other savings plans</b>
            <ul>
              <li>An Education Savings Account (ESA) gives you more investment options than a 529 plan, but annual contribution limits are lower and income limits apply.</li>
              <li>A custodial account is a trust fund anyone can open as a benefit to another person (like a child). It might not provide all of the tax advantages of a 529 or ESA, but withdrawals can be used by the beneficiary for any purpose.
              </li>
              <li>With U.S. Savings Bonds, all or part of the interest you earn on Series EE and I Bonds might be tax-free when used for qualified educational expenses, but income limits apply.

          <li><b>How much should you save?</b><ul>
            <li>The total cost of your degree will depend on your family’s finances, how much aid you qualify for, whether you attend a public or private school, and whether you stay close to home or attend school in another state. For example, many schools
              offer discounted tuition to in-state residents. You can use a college savings calculator to stay on track.</li>
