      <div class="content">
        <ul>
          <li><b>What is the FAFSA?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> (FAFSA) provides details about your family’s financial situation to the U.S. Department of Education. The information
                is then shared with the colleges you intend to apply to and state agencies where those schools are located.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Why you should fill out the FAFSA
</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The FAFSA is your gateway to federal, state, and school-based student aid. That includes federal student loans (money you have to pay back), grants (money you don’t have to pay back), and work-study positions (money you have to work for).</li>
              <li>Even if you don’t think you’ll qualify for need-based grant aid, you should fill out the FAFSA because it’s used by many states and schools to evaluate your eligibility for grants and scholarships.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Tips for filling out the FAFSA</b>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">Fill out the FAFSA</a> as soon as possible after the application window opens on Oct. 1. Many grants and scholarships that are available on a first-come, first-served
                basis require that you fill out the FAFSA to qualify. </li>
              <li><a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">Apply for the FAFSA online</a> or by using the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/announcements/fafsa-mobile-options" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">FAFSA mobile app</a>. </li>
              <li>Round up all the documents and information you’ll need before starting your application. This includes <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out#documents" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">your personal and financial information</a> (typically your parents’
                info, too) like your Social Security number, proof of income, tax forms, and more.</li>
              <li><a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out#schools" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">List every school that you plan to apply to</a> on your FAFSA, so that those schools have the information they need to determine how much financial aid they can offer you.

              <li>Filling out the FAFSA is often the first step for qualifying for these programs, but you still have to apply directly to the agency administering the financial aid program in your state. <a href="https://www.nasfaa.org/State_Financial_Aid_Programs" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">Use this map</a> to find your agency.</li>

              <li>Many selective schools allow students to apply in October or November for an “early action” or “early decision” admission plan. Check with the admissions office of each school you’re interested in attending for specifics. The <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying-101/the-facts-about-applying-early-is-it-right-for-you" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">College Board</a>                and <a href="https://www.petersons.com/blog/early-action-vs-regular-decision-myths/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">Peterson’s</a> have good overviews of factors to consider if you’re thinking of applying early.</li>

          <li><b>Tips for applying to college</b>
            <ul>
              <li>It’s important to apply to more than one college, so you can compare several schools that are willing to admit you. Keep in mind that each application will cost you time and money — around $50, on average.</li>
              <li>Here are some more <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/apply-to-college/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">tips for applying to college</a>, and the pros and cons of applying for an early decision admission.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>What happens if you miss an application deadline?</b>
              <ul>
                <li>If you procrastinated or were just unsure about whether you wanted to go to college in the fall, there are plenty of <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying-101/late-applications" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">colleges that accept applications after Jan. 1</a>. Check with any schools that you’re interested in attending as some schools might have openings that they’re eager to fill, and will accept late applications.</li>

          <li><b>What is a financial aid award letter?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Financial aid award letters arrive around the same time as admission offer letters. Assuming that you remembered to list them on your FAFSA, every college that offers to admit you should send you a <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/how-to-apply-for-student-loans/#six" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">financial aid award letter</a>.</li>
              <li>The letter should provide all the information you need to compare the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/comparing-aid-offers" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">net price of attendance (total cost of attendance</a> minus any gift aid like grants or scholarships)

            <ul>
              <li>Financial aid award letters can be difficult to compare because some schools don’t provide a total cost of attendance or make clear that loans are aid you have to repay. Here are some examples of how the letters might look and how you can

        <ul>
          <li><b>What is the deadline for accepting offers?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The deadline for accepting a college’s offer for fall admission and putting down a tuition deposit of $50 to $500 is typically May 1.</li>
              <li>If you’ve applied for early decision admission, you can expect to hear whether you’ve been accepted in December. Tuition deposits for students applying for early decision admission are often due before May 1, but check with your school first.

          <li><b>Why you need to put down a tuition deposit</b>
            <ul>
              <li>A tuition deposit secures your place at your school of choice and demonstrates your commitment to showing up. Schools need to plan ahead so that they can provide the teaching staff and accommodations each incoming class will need.</li>
              <li>Some students will put off their final decision by paying tuition deposits to more than one school, which is <a href="https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/applications/ethics" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">considered unethical</a> unless you’ve been waitlisted

              <li>Expect to pay interest charges on any past due balances on your tuition bill, which must be paid in full before you can register for future classes or obtain transcripts of your grades.</li>
             <li>Most families take out student loans to pay for college. If you’re not seeing credits for federal student loans that you’re counting on to pay your bill, make sure you’ve completed the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/entrance-counseling" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">required entrance counseling</a> and signed a promissory note. </li>
</ul>
        <li><b>How to take out student loans</b>
           <ul>
              <li>The first step to taking out federal loans is to fill out the <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> (FAFSA). You can fill out the FAFSA for the 2019-20 academic year until June 30, 2020.</li>
             <li>If you’ve hit your <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/student-loan-limits/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">federal student loan limits</a>, consider using federal PLUS or private student loans to cover unmet funding needs. These loans <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/student-loans-living-expenses/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">can be used for living expenses</a>.</li>
             <li>You should always <a href="https://www.credible.com/student-loans" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">compare rates from multiple lenders</a> before taking out a private loan to get the best terms for your situation.    </li>

          <li><b>When do you have to start repaying your loans?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Most federal student loans and private loans provide a 6-month “grace period” after you leave school before you have to start making monthly payments.</li>
              <li>If you have <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/subsidized-vs-unsubsidized-student-loans-which-is-for-you/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">federal direct subsidized loans</a>, interest doesn’t start racking up until after your grace period has ended.</li>
              <li>With any other type of loan, interest starts accruing as soon as you take your loans out. So starting repayment as soon as you can will help you <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/refinance-student-loans/pay-off-student-loans/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">pay off your student loans faster</a>.</li>
              <li>You can use our <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/calculators/student-loan-repayment-calculator/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">student loan repayment calculator</a> to figure out how long it will take you to pay off your total student loan balance.
</li>
            </ul>
          <li><b>What are the different repayment options?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>There are many options for repaying federal student loans, ranging from the standard 10-year repayment plan to extended or income-driven repayment plans.</li>
              <li>If you have private student loans, you picked a repayment plan when you took out your loan. If you decided to defer or make partial payments while in school, your monthly payment might increase.</li>
              <li>Many borrowers <a href="https://www.credible.com/refinance-student-loans/" class="timelinelink" target="_blank">choose to refinance their student loans</a> at lower rates after graduation.</li>
