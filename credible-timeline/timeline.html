There are a <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/pay-for-college">couple of 529 plans</a> you can use to pay for college tuition and expenses.

              <li>An <a href="http://www.finra.org/investors/esa-and-custodial-accounts">Education Savings Account</a> (ESA) gives you more investment options than a 529 plan, but annual contribution limits are lower and income limits apply.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.finaid.org/savings/ugma.phtml">A custodial account</a> is a trust fund anyone can open as a benefit to another person (like a child). It might not provide all of the tax advantages of a 529 or ESA, but withdrawals can

      <div class="content">
        <ul>
          <li><b>What is the FAFSA?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The <a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa/">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> (FAFSA) provides details about your family’s financial situation to the U.S. Department of Education. The information
                is then shared with the colleges you intend to apply to and state agencies where those schools are located.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Why you should fill out the FAFSA
</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The FAFSA is your gateway to federal, state, and school-based student aid. That includes federal student loans (money you have to pay back), grants (money you don’t have to pay back), and work-study positions (money you have to work for).</li>
              <li>Even if you don’t think you’ll qualify for need-based grant aid, you should fill out the FAFSA because it’s used by many states and schools to evaluate your eligibility for grants and scholarships.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Tips for filling out the FAFSA</b>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.credible.com/blog/student-loans/applying-for-fafsa/">Fill out the FAFSA</a> as soon as possible after the application window opens on Oct. 1. Many grants and scholarships that are available on a first-come, first-served
                basis require that you fill out the FAFSA to qualify. </li>
              <li><a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa">Apply for the FAFSA online</a> or by using the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/announcements/fafsa-mobile-options">FAFSA mobile app</a>. </li>
              <li>Round up all the documents and information you’ll need before starting your application. This includes <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out#documents">your personal and financial information</a> (typically your parents’
                info, too) like your Social Security number, proof of income, tax forms, and more.</li>
              <li><a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out#schools">List every school that you plan to apply to</a> on your FAFSA, so that those schools have the information they need to determine how much financial aid they can offer you.

              <li>Filling out the FAFSA is often the first step for qualifying for these programs, but you still have to apply directly to the agency administering the financial aid program in your state. <a href="https://www.nasfaa.org/State_Financial_Aid_Programs">Use this map</a>                to find your agency.</li>

              <li>Financial aid award letters arrive around the same time as admission offer letters.
